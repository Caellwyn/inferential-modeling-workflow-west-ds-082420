    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "We started with a baseline model where the only input feature was `Schooling`.  Our baseline model had an r-squared of 0.565.  This model violated the linearity (p < 0.001), normality (p < 0.001), and homoscadasticity (p < 0.001) assumptions of linear regression.  The independence assumption was met by default because there was only one input feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final model for this lesson had three input features: `Schooling`, `Adult_Mortality`, and `Status_Encoded`.  It had an r-squared of 0.718.  This model did not violate the linearity assumption (p = 0.084), but it did violate the normality (p < 0.001) and homoscedasticity (p < 0.001) assumptions.  Based on the variance inflaction factor metric, it did not violate the independence assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are able to address the following questions from above:\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. Does various predicting factors which has been chosen initially really affect the Life expectancy? What are the predicting variables actually affecting the life expectancy?*\n",
    "\n",
    "With only 3 features we are able to explain about 71% of the variance in life expectancy.  This indicates that these factors truly are explanatory.  More analysis is required to understand how much additional explanatory power would be provided by incorporating additional features into the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. How does Infant and Adult mortality rates affect life expectancy?*\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have only investigated adult mortality.  The adult mortality rate (\"probability of dying between 15 and 60 years per 1000 population\") has a negative correlation with life expectancy.  For each increase of 1 in the adult mortality rate, life expectancy decreases by about .03 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "*5. What is the impact of schooling on the lifespan of humans?*\n",
    "\n",
    "In our latest model, we find that each additional year of average schooling is associated with 1.4 years of added life expectancy.  However it is challenging to interpret whether it is schooling that is actually having the impact.  Schooling is highly correlated with `Income_Composition_of_Resources` (\"Human Development Index in terms of income composition of resources\") so it is very possible that schooling is the result of some underlying factor that also impacts life expectancy, rather than schooling impacting life expectancy directly."
